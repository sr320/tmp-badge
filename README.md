## What are Reproducible Research & Open Science Badges?

These are small signals that recognize your efforts to improve the reproducibility and openness of your research. Inspiration from these comes from the [Open Science Framework Badges to Acknowledge Open Practices Project](https://osf.io/tvyxz/). The goals of these badges are to:

- have a low-stakes program to raise the visibility on campus of people doing reproducible research and open science
- provide some simple incentives to working reproducibly and in the open
- get researchers who are new to these ideas onto a trajectory of improvement
- communicate to people the key principles and tools for reproducible research and open science 

# How do I get a Reproducible Research & Open Science Badge?

Badges will be awarded to individual researchers who self-certify by listing URLs of their research products as evidence of their eligibility for a badge. The criterion is ordered within each Category in order of difficulty.

###Submit your evidence completing **[this survey](http://goo.gl/forms/jm08DOJ2EI)** 

Everyone will get a badge! Badges will be customized based on your total score as described in the table below.

## What do the Badges look like?
There will two forms for the badges, a generic one: ![starter](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge--green.svg). Based on your point value as 
shown in the table below, you can share a personalized badge (ie ![silver](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-56-yellow.svg)).  Thanks to <shields.io> for providing this service! 

| Level   | Criteria   |
|-------- |  --------- |
| Gold    | 50 points  |
| Silver  | 25 points |
| Bronze  | 10 points  |
