## What are Reproducible Research & Open Science Badges?

These are small signals that recognize your efforts to improve the reproducibility and openness of your research. Inspiration from these comes from the [Open Science Framework Badges to Acknowledge Open Practices Project](https://osf.io/tvyxz/). The goals of these badges are to:

- have a low-stakes program to raise the visibility on campus of people doing reproducible research and open science
- provide some simple incentives to working reproducibly and in the open
- get researchers who are new to these ideas onto a trajectory of improvement
- communicate to people the key principles and tools for reproducible research and open science 

# How do I get a Reproducible Research & Open Science Badge?

Badges will be awarded to individual researchers who self-certify by listing URLs of their research products as evidence of their eligibility for a badge. The criterion is ordered within each Category in order of difficulty.

###Submit your evidence completing **[this survey](http://goo.gl/forms/jm08DOJ2EI)** 

Everyone will get a badge! Badges will be customized based on your total score as described in the table below.


## Reproducible Research & Open Science Badge Criteria

## What do the Badges look like?
There will two forms for the badges, a generic one: ![starter](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge--green.svg). Based on your point value as 
shown in the table below, you can share a personalized badge (ie ![silver](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-56-yellow.svg)).  Thanks to <http://shields.io/> for providing this service! 

| Level   | Criteria   |
|-------- |  --------- |
| Gold    | 50 points  |
| Silver  | 25 points |
| Bronze  | 10 points  |

## How do I get my embed code?
Well we are working on making it more automated however you can role your own using this tutorial.

Anyone that takes [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WqeQRmPi42pD-OqHxTqfA7aWqgPrkNjV8PTixA-m2sI/viewform?c=0&w=1) is welcome to use this badge: ![starter](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge--green.svg) !  

Here is the code

```
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sr320/tmp-badge/blob/master/rros-badge-web.html"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge--green.svg" alt="ROS Badge"></a>
```

To generate a custom badge you will have to tweak the code a bit. Below are three examples for ![gold](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Gold-yellow.svg), ![silver](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Silver-lightgrey.svg), and ![bronze](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Bronze-yellowgreen.svg).

 ![gold](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Gold-yellow.svg)

```
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sr320/tmp-badge/blob/master/rros-badge-web.html"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-75-yellow.svg" alt="ROS Badge"></a>
```

Would generate this badge ![75](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-75-yellow.svg).  Just change `75` in the code to reflect your point value. 

 ![silver](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Silver-lightgrey.svg)

```
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sr320/tmp-badge/blob/master/rros-badge-web.html"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-30-silver.svg" alt="ROS Badge"></a>
```

Would generate this badge ![30](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-30-lightgrey.svg).  Just change `30` in the code to reflect your point value. 


 ![bronze](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Bronze-yellowgreen.svg)

```
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sr320/tmp-badge/blob/master/rros-badge-web.html"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-10-yellowgreen.svg" alt="ROS Badge"></a>
```

Would generate this badge ![10](https://img.shields.io/badge/RROS%20Badge-10-yellowgreen.svg).  Just change `10` in the code to reflect your point value.
